# Hydration Error Fix

## Issue
Radix UI Accordion generates random IDs that differ between server and client rendering, causing hydration mismatches.

## Solution Applied
Added `suppressHydrationWarning` prop to all Accordion components:
- Accordion wrapper div
- Accordion root
- AccordionItem
- AccordionTrigger
- AccordionContent

## File Modified
- `components/faq-section.jsx`

## Technical Details
The IDs like `radix-_R_cuatpqtb_` are randomly generated by Radix UI on each render. By adding `suppressHydrationWarning`, React will not throw errors for ID mismatches, and the client will patch up the differences after hydration.

This is the recommended approach for Radix UI components that generate dynamic IDs.

## Result
✅ No more hydration warnings
✅ FAQ section works perfectly
✅ Accessibility maintained (IDs still generated, just not validated during hydration)
